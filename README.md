####  _{Brief description of application}_


## Technologies Used

* HTML
* JavaScript 
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
* Git, Git BASH 
* GitHub (remote repository)
* Markdown (this document) 
* Markdown 'details' tag  (creates dropdown that contains, in this case, all the TDD Test Blocks) 


## Description

(Write full description here)

Other notes: 
* This program's Business Logic was built up using Test-Driven Development (TDD). To see the tests I used, look no further than the next section. 
* For those wondering how to implement dropdowns/spoilers (like below) in Markdown,  I Googled 'details tag markdown' and found this website:  https://spinningnumbers.org/a/details.html#details-markdown-template .   (Yes, I used that template for the dropdown in this document)

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* All that's required to run this application -- at minimum -- is:  a decently-performing laptop, and a reliable Internet connection. 
* To Clone the program from the GitHub repo to your local machine: 
  * 1.)    Click the green button labelled 'Code'. Under the 'HTTPS' tab, there are 3 Options. If you know how to use Git in command line and have Git BASH installed, move on to Step 2a.    Otherwise, I recommend Option 3, where it says 'Download ZIP'. (move on to Step 2b).  
  * 2.)
    * a.)   If you selected Option 1:   Copy the link. Then, in Git BASH, navigate to the folder you want to put the files in. This can be your Desktop directory, or a different subfolder, whatever you prefer. Next, still in the Git BASH console, type the following (with the copied-link in place of 'HTTPS') and hit ENTER:  
    'git clone HTTPS' 
    Several lines of text will come up in the console -- that's the files being copied into whichever directory/folder you're in currently.  Then, do the following once your prompt line reappears:   While still in the console window, type 'pwd' and press ENTER.  This will display your current file path. Copy that by highlighting it and pressing 'Ctrl-C', and then pasting it in an easily-accessible word processor like Notepad for reference.    
    Next, open File Explorer, and navigate to through your files according to that File Path you just copy-pasted for reference.  Once you've done this, move on to Step 3. 
    
    * 2b.)  Once the '.zip' file is downloaded, unzip and open the folder.  Next, move on to Step 3.

  * 3.)  Before opening the HTML file, do the following:   right-click the containing folder (in which the newly-copied files are stored)  and select the option that says 'Pin to Quick Access'. That way, if the tab is accidentally closed for whatever reason and you want to reopen it, the folder can be accessed again in one step.  
  Move on to Step 4. 
  
  * 4.)  To open the webpage, double-click the file named  "pizza.html". The webpage will then be opened in a new browser tab.  Everything else after that should be self-explanatory. 
* IMPORTANT:  the webpage's interactive features will not work if the files' containing folder doesn't look something like this  (names with a '/' are folders):  
'css/'     'js/'     'pizza.html'     'README.md'
